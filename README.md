## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to filter the given database (hawaii.sqlite) by both June and December and retrieve the summary temperature statistics for both months. 

## Results
When comparing the 2 screenshots below, there are a few major insights that we can gather.

1. The average minimum temperatures are lower in December compared to June. 
2. The maximum temperature remained relatively the same.
3. There is a lower number of observations in December compared to June. 

## Summary
As discussed above, indicate that there are generally lower temperatures in December compared to June, however the maximum can stay relatively the same. To gain more accurate insights, there may be a need to increase observations during the month of December. I believe that it would be helpful to include queries with precipiation data and station data for both December and June. By including these two queries we can see the differences in precipitation between the two months and the number of observations that stations are recording in order to correct for the lower count in December. Furthermore, it may also be interesting to see a histogram of temperature distributions during the given months to have a better idea of how the temperature changes and compares.
